I am currently a PhD Student at CU Boulder in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, working in the [Climate Processes and Predictability](aneeshhcs.com) research group. My background includes an undergraduate degree in Physics, a Masters in Civil and Environmental Engineering, and 5 years in environmental consulting before making my way back to research in the Fall of 2021. I am interested in the intersection of process-based models and observations, and am currently working on ways of using machine learning to improve data assimilation methods.

# Research Interests
* Non-linear data assimilation
